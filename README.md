# Score File (*.scof)
Music score format developed for ScoreFall based on a zip file.

## Format
Format is in a zip file.  An example contents are in `scof/`.  A schema describing the format is in `schema/`.

## Language

- Schema for formatting (page breaks, line breaks, customized spacing, font choice)
