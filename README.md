# Score File (*.scof)
Music score format developed for ScoreFall based on IMU (Icy MarkUp).

## Format
Format is in a zip file.  An example contents are in `scof/`.  A schema describing the format is in `schema/`.

## Language
Each file is based on MuON (Mu Object Notation).  Details can be found in `schema`.

### TODO
- File for musical ideas (notes - a movement)
- File for synthesis (soundfont data, instruments)
- File for formatting (page breaks, line breaks, customized spacing, font choice)
- File for metadata (composer, title, copyright, movement order)
- Answer: Do we have 4 files in the ZIP?
